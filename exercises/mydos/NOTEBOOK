# Exercise MyDOS

## Steps 1, 2 and 3
We just exported the project to the repository, and renamed it to LDOS - 
the Last Dance Operating System. The name is a reference to the fact that
Operating Systems 2 (which is this course) is the last course one of the
students from the team is taking before graduating.

Overall, not many difficulties here. Exploring TyDOS and TyFS was very helpful
and paved the way to incoming steps.

## Step 4
We just removed all references to the external program prog.c, both from Makefile,
tydos.ld and kernel.c

## Step 5
Included the disk.img image, formated with 4 block for boot, and a rule in Makefile
for creating the image populated with zeros.

Also included a program `whatever.c` in the disk. Just a plain Hello World in C.

## Step 6 and 7
Included rule for copying the OS binary to the disk. Flag `seek` is used to start copy
after the first 16 bytes of the disk, and flag `skip` is used to ignore the first 16
bytes from the binary. It seems that these 16 first bytes from the binary are not
important, so that's why building the OS from the disk worked (even though we are not
sure).

Also booted the OS from the disk.
