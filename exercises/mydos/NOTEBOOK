# Exercise MyDOS

## Steps 1, 2 and 3
We just exported the project to the repository, and renamed it to LDOS - 
the Last Dance Operating System. The name is a reference to the fact that
Operating Systems 2 (which is this course) is the last course one of the
students from the team is taking before graduating.

Overall, not many difficulties here. Exploring TyDOS and TyFS was very helpful
and paved the way to incoming steps.

## Step 4
We just removed all references to the external program prog.c, both from Makefile,
tydos.ld and kernel.c
