# Exercise
### Disclaimer
For items B and C, we used the Intel assembly language from eg-00,
as this is simpler and easier to implement. We struggled with translating
AT&T Gas assembly concepts into C code that could assemble this asm code.

In our implementation, for simplifying purposes, we did not implement
labels, as this would require keeping track of different labels
throughout the program, and keeping pace of memory address as assembling
process occurred.

So we are sticking with Intel assembly, as well as a non-label implementation.

## Item D
They have an exact match.

Initially, our implementation produced a binary that was slightly different
from eg-00.bin, due to not implementing the `.word` directive. After
noticing this, we updated our C program to accept this directive as well.

## Item E
The output is very similar to what was produced by dissamble script. The
major differences go to the fact that originally we used char letters
to represent `Hello World`. In the disassembled code, however, it used
hexdecimal code, so it looks more like byte code.

## Item F
It worked!
